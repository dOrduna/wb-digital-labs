# Simple Virtual DOM Benchmarking Tool

This is an attempt at implementing the infamous virtual DOM in a very simple way with the goal of comparing its performance against conventional rendering and, in the future, other more sophisticated technologies.

## Instructions
Pretty standard, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window and go to the directory you wish to clone the repo into.
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/dOrduna/wb-digital-labs.git`
3. Run `cd wb-digital-labs/`
3. Run `npm install`
4. For dev mode, run `npm run dev` and that should open a browser window automatically. You can also run `npm run prod` which will create a `dist` folder where you will find a file called `index.html`. Open it and you should see the tool in action.
